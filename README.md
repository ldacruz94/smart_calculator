# Smart Calculator

# About

This is a little project I wrote to try out the C++ language (revamped now).

As of the date of the update for this readme, I've decided to work on more C++ and Golang projects.

This project is to create a smart calculator where it understands how to parse an inputted math expression from a user that includes the following operations: +,/,*,- and produces an output.

# Learnings

Going to come soon after I finish this up.
